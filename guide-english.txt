In this little guide, I'll explain how to use my memory patch to prevent crashes in Emergency 4. Whether you have the Steam version, the good old CD version, or 911: First Responders â€“ this patch works with all of them.

Step 1: Let's get started!
First things first: Grab the file you need:
https://github.com/annabelsandford/em4_mem_patch/releases/tag/v2.2.0

Extract the stuff from the ZIP file into a folder.
ðŸŸ¥ Important: Unpack it, don't just run it, folks! ðŸŸ¥

Step 2: Patch time
In the unpacked mess, look for "EM4P.exe". Just click on it and off you go.
To avoid errors, right-click on it and select "Run as administrator".

A window will pop up showing you a few options.

Step 2.5: Language stuff
If English isn't your thing, click on the flag in the top right. There you can switch the whole thing to either German or English. (Personally, I prefer English. Not sure about you tho)

Step 3: Choose Emergency 4 Exe
Click on "Patch or Repair (*.EXE)", locate the Emergency 4 exe file, and confirm it. Make sure to select the exe file in the Emergency 4 installation path, not the ModInstaller.

Step 4: Steam "Yes" or Steam "No"
Steam or no Steam? If it's Steam, then "Yes". If you got your game through other means, then "No, it's a Non-Steam Version".

Step 5: Which version of the game?
Choose whether you have "Emergency 4" or "911: First Responders".

Step 6: Make a backup (Smart move in my professional opinion lol)
Seriously, it's best to create a backup of your game files before you apply the patch. It helps if something goes wrong.

The patch will now be applied to the game to reduce crashes.

"Hey, I tried the patch and now my EM4 won't start / keeps crashing" or something.
No worries, the EM4 Memory Patcher has a built-in repair function.

Step 1: Repair!
Click on "EM4P.exe" again and start it.

Step 2: Repair game exe
Click on "Choose EXE", locate the "broken" Emergency 4 exe file. The patch will automatically check if a repair is wanted (Yes, this thing is that smart. You just have to select it).

Step 3: Carry out the repair
The program will probably ask you if you want to repair. Click "Yes".

The repair will be applied to the patched exe. Sometimes you might have to do it 2 or 3 times. If it's still stuck after 3 tries, reach out to us.
